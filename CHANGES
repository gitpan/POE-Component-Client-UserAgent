    Prepare for a new release.

  t/02multi.t M; t/03chunks.t M; t/01basic.t M; UserAgent.pm M

    [rt.cpan.org 31287] Fix http_proxy environment variable support,
    contributed by Georg Moritz. Untested! LWP::Parallel will not
    install. My LWP is too new for it. 

  2009-07-27 04:58:17 (r13) by rcaputo; Makefile.PL M; UserAgent.pm M

    Added a machine-readable repository directory to the distribution.
    Documented the bug tracker, repository, and other resource URLs.

  CHANGES.OLD A; MANIFEST M; Makefile.PL M; Changes D

    Moved the hand-written Changes to CHANGES.OLD, making room for the
    automated CHANGES at "make dist" time. Speaking of distributions, I
    removed META.yml from the MANIFEST since MakeMaker makes one. I also
    added svn-log.perl to Makefile.PL to auto-generate CHANGES. 

  2005-05-05 05:36:16 (r11) by rcaputo; MANIFEST M

    Add META.yml to the MANIFEST.
