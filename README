Abstract
--------

POE::Component::Client::UserAgent is an asynchronous, event driven
LWP and LWP::Parallel based user agent POE component. It lets other
tasks run while making a request to an Internet server and waiting
for a response, and it lets several requests run in parallel.

Requirements
------------

This module requires POE, LWP and LWP::Parallel. Version 0.03 of the
component requires POE version 0.1402 and LWP::Parallel version 2.51,
which in turn requires LWP version 2.52 or later.

Availability
------------

The most recent POE::Component::Client::UserAgent distribution
is available on the web at http://www.en-directo.net/poe/

I am also planning to upload it to the CPAN.

The most recent version of the component documentation is available
at http://www.en-directo.net/poe/useragent.html

Installation
------------

This module has not yet been posted on CPAN, so manual installation
is the only option so far.

Create a makefile:

  perl Makefile.PL

Optionally run test scripts:

  make test

Install the module:

  make install

You can also extract the archive manually. The component is written
entirely in Perl and requires no compilation.

Usage
-----

An example of usage is found in the built in documentation, as well
as on the manual page on the web, see Availability.

Test scripts are also good examples of the component usage.
